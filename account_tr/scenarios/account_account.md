**Functional Scenario Steps:**

1. Open the Odoo application and navigate to the "Accounting" module.
2. Locate the "Account Account" model and understand that it has been extended to include additional functionality.
3. Understand that the purpose of the added functionality is to determine and store a specifier value ("asset", "income", or "expense") based on the account type of the account.
4. Note that the specifier value indicates the type of account for easy classification.
5. Notice that the specifier field is computed using the "_compute_specifier" method, which takes into account the account type field.
6. Understand that the specifier field is stored for performance reasons and can be changed by users if needed.
7. Locate the "Account Account" model again and observe that the account type field has been extended to include additional selections.
8. Note the added account types: "Check", "Tax", "Current Profit & Loss", and "Other".
9. Understand that these account types can be used to further classify and categorize accounts.
10. Note that when an account with one of the added account types is deleted, it will also delete related records that are linked to it.
11. Understand that this cascade deletion ensures data integrity and consistency.
12. Take note of any specific requirements or considerations when working with the extended functionality.

**Expected Results:**

- The extended functionality allows for easy classification and categorization of accounts based on their type.
- The specifier field accurately reflects the account type, making it easier to identify and classify accounts.
- The added account types provide more flexibility and options for categorizing accounts.
- When an account with one of the added account types is deleted, any related records linked to it are also deleted, ensuring data integrity.
- Users can modify the specifier field if needed, providing flexibility in account classification.
